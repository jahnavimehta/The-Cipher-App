## Features

- **Easy Message Encryption:**  CipherApp offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to quickly encrypt any text message you enter. Simply type your message, click on the "Encode the data" button, and CipherApp will use AES encryption to convert your text into a secure ciphertext.

- **Secure Decryption:** Need to retrieve the original message? No problem! CipherApp provides a simple "Decode the data" button that allows you to decrypt the ciphertext and view the original text.

- **Data Security:** Your data's security is our top priority. CipherApp leverages the Android Keystore system to securely store encryption keys and ensure your messages are protected from unauthorized access.

- **Minimalist Design:** CipherApp boasts an elegant and intuitive design, providing a seamless user experience. The minimalist UI allows you to focus on the task at hand â€“ encrypting and decrypting your messages with ease.


## Technology Aspect:

-**AES Encryption Algorithm:** CipherApp uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for message encryption. AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency. With AES, messages are transformed into ciphertext using a secret encryption key, ensuring that only authorized parties with the key can decrypt and access the original message.

-**Android Keystore System:** To ensure the security of encryption keys and protect user data, CipherApp employs the Android Keystore system. The Android Keystore provides a secure hardware-backed storage for cryptographic keys, making it resistant to tampering and unauthorized access. By using the Keystore, CipherApp can securely generate, store, and manage the encryption keys required for AES encryption and decryption.

-**Kotlin Programming Language:** CipherApp is written in Kotlin, a modern and expressive programming language that has become the preferred choice for Android app development. Kotlin offers concise syntax, null safety, and functional programming capabilities, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.

-**Compose UI Toolkit:** CipherApp utilizes the Compose UI toolkit, introduced by Android, for building the app's user interface. Compose allows for declarative and reactive UI development, enabling developers to create dynamic and responsive UIs with less boilerplate code.
